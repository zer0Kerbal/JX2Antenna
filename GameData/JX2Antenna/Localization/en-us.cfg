		#JX2-Agency-titl = Sphero-Hedron Engineering Dynamics
		#JX2-Agency-desc = At the cutting edge of multifaceted, lightweight outdoor storage facilities, Sphero-Hedron Engineering Dynamics are now using their patented 'Ply-n-Pine' construction technique in the emerging off-world market.

		#JX2-tags = JX2

	// Parts
		#JX2-ju1MDA-titl = JU1 Medium Deployable Antenna
		#JX2-ju1MDA-desc = This rather good sized, high-powered antenna was originally a garden variety umbrella. Commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC, this part is great for easy-to-launch, long range relay satellites.

		#JX2-jw1MDA-titl = JW1 Medium Deployable Antenna
		#JX2-jw1MDA-desc = This rather large, high-powered antenna was created as an off-shoot of the tech domenstrator from the JX2. Commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC, this part is primarily targeted for those probes and rovers destined to head a bit further out than the last lot...

		#JX2-jx2LDA-titl = JX2 Large Deployable Antenna
		#JX2-jx2LDA-desc = This enormous, high-powered relay antenna was commissioned by Blinkenlights LLC after someone asked "What happens if we go further out than the Kerbol system?"  It most definitely is not in response to any vessels having accidentally already achieved an escape trajectory from the system.  Nope, nothing to do with that issue at all.
